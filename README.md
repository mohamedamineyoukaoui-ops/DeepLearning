## Overview

**Tactical Vision** is a football analysis system that detects players, referees, and the ball from tactical camera footage, predicts team assignments based on jersey colors, and projects positions onto a 2D tactical map in real-time.

### Project Goals
- Automate football match analysis
- Provide real-time tactical visualization
- Enable data-driven decision making for coaches and analysts

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Player Detection** | Detect players, referees, and ball using YOLOv8 |
| **Team Prediction** | Classify players by team using jersey color analysis (K-means + LAB color space) |
| **Tactical Map** | Project player positions onto a 2D pitch representation via homography |
| **Ball Tracking** | Track ball movement across frames with position history |
| **Field Keypoints** | Detect 28 field landmarks for accurate coordinate transformation |
| **GPU Accelerated** | FP16 inference with CUDA optimization for ~40 FPS processing |

---

## Demo

### Streamlit Web Application

### Models

| Model | Architecture | Parameters | Purpose | Training |
|-------|--------------|------------|---------|----------|
| Players | YOLOv8L | 43.7M | Detect players, refs, ball | 30 epochs |
| Keypoints | YOLOv8M | 25.9M | Detect 28 field landmarks | 20 epochs |

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended)
- 6GB+ VRAM for optimal performance

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamedamineyoukaoui-ops/DeepLearning.git
cd DeepLearning
```

2. **Create conda environment**
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate football-analytics
```

Or install with pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Download model weights**

Download the pre-trained weights and place them in the `models/` directory:
- Players Model (YOLOv8L) - 83MB → `models/Yolo8L Players/weights/best.pt`
- Keypoints Model (YOLOv8M) - 50MB → `models/Yolo8M Field Keypoints/weights/best.pt`

4. **Download demo videos**

Place demo videos in the `Streamlit web app/` directory:
- Demo Video 1 → `demo_vid_1.mp4`
- Demo Video 2 → `demo_vid_2.mp4`

## Usage

### Streamlit Web Application

```bash
cd "Streamlit web app"
streamlit run main.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

### FastAPI Backend

```bash
cd web-app-api
uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

API available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Jupyter Notebook

For experimentation and analysis:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Football Object Detection With Tactical Map.ipynb"
```

## Datasets

The models were trained on custom annotated datasets:

| Dataset | Images | Annotations | Classes |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Players Dataset | 600 | 12,801 | Player, Referee, Ball |
| Field Keypoints | 342 | 4,747 | 28 field landmarks |

---

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Proposed Solution |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Intermittent ball detection | High | Lower threshold + temporal interpolation |
| Occluded players | Moderate | Multi-object tracker (DeepSORT/ByteTrack) |
| Team color confusion | Low (~15%) | Fine-tuning color picker |
| HD resolution latency | Variable | TensorRT optimization |
